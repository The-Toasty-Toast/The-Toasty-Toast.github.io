     <p class="yD1"> Ah! Are you here to change the volume?</p>
     <p class="Y">Yes</p>

     <p class="yD2">Excellent, I can help with that! It is my function 
      after all. I am able to turn volumes up then down and sometimes up again.
      Or sometime it is up then down and down again or maybe even down then up and down again! 
    </p>

    <p class="yD3"> I'm getting ahead of myself. Before I am able to adjust the 
      volume for you I will need a bit more information. You will need you to fill out this page
      then I would be delighted to make according volume adjustments!
    </p>

  <!--Add in form of bubble or y/n choices -->

  <p class="yD4"> Thank you so much for your input! Though I am required to say that that step was just 
    to make sure that you really did want to change the volume. I hope you don't mind, my function is to 
    adjust the volume to the best of my capacity! 

    Now, we have astablished that you want to change the volume (I mean actualy wanted to change the volume) 
    would you like to increase or lower the volume?
  </p>
  <p class="increase">increase</p>
  <p class="lower">lower</p>

  <p class="yD5"> Wonderful choice, please wait just a moment while I make that adjustment!
  </p>
<!-- Add in pictures of volume meater as a stationary image or gif of it changing by one incerment-->
<p class="yD6">There you go, all compleate! That is all I can provide you at this time 
  but it has been a pleasure adjusting the volume user. It is gratifying to preform my function 
  please come back again soon!  </p>



     <p class="N">No</p>
     <p class="nD1"> Well that is a shame. Really most unfortunate... 
      But here have a look at some cute baby animals to make up for it. </p>

      <!-- Add in pictures of cute animals-->
