<p> The <strong>corgi</strong> (or <strong>Welsh corgi</strong>) is a small breed of dog. 
	It comes from Wales.

There are two breeds: the Pembroke Welsh corgi and the Cardigan Welsh corgi. 
Queen Elizabeth II has kept pet Pembroke Welsh corgis since she was seven years old.[1]

Corgis have a long torso and short legs, large bones, and a very short tail. 
Corgis were originally bred as herding dogs. They are very active and like exercise.
 They are intelligent and have good memories.</p>

<p>Outside Wales, corgis have been made popular by Queen Elizabeth II. She usually had at 
least four as pets and once as many as thirteen.[1] Her first corgi was named Susan. She 
mated Susan and her current dogs are still offspring of that breeding.[1] She now has two 
corgis who are about twelve years old.[1] Some portraits of Queen Elizabeth II show her 
holding a corgi or a few around her.[2][1]</p>
