<p>Outside Wales, corgis have been made popular by Queen Elizabeth II. She usually had at 
least four as pets and once as many as thirteen.[1] Her first corgi was named Susan. She 
mated Susan and her current dogs are still offspring of that breeding.[1] She now has two 
corgis who are about twelve years old.[1] Some portraits of Queen Elizabeth II show her 
holding a corgi or a few around her.[2][1]</p>
