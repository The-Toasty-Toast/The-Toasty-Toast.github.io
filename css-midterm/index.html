        </h1>
        <p id="Bio">Sophie Berry is working to become both a designer and engineer. She has gained experience with many forms of graphic 
          design through a wide variety of course work in order to effectively communicate ideas and messages in a visual manner. 
          She has developed her skills with programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign in the Adobe Suite to overcome 
          the unique challenges of different assignments. She also has experience writing proposals and 3D modeling designs for other
           mock up design proposals of potential products. With her experience she would be an asset in the planning, designing and 
           the developing of products and proposals. </p>
